	<p> &lt;wbr&gt; 태그 이용은 밑이다.<br><p>In many religions, philosophical, and mythological traditions,
		the soul is the incorporeal essence of a living being.[1] Depending on
		the philosophical system, a soul can either be mortal or immortal.[2]
		In Judeo-Christianity, only human beings have immortal souls (although
		immortality is disputed within Judaism and may have been influenced by
		Plato).<wbr>[3] For example, the Catholic theologian Thomas Aquinas
		attributed "soul" (anima) to all organisms but argued that only human
		souls are immortal.[4]<wbr> Other religions (most notably Hinduism and
		Jainism) hold that all biological organisms have souls, as did
		Aristotle, while some teach that even non-biological entities (such as
		rivers and mountains) possess souls. The latter belief is called
		animism.[5]<wbr> Greek philosophers, such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle,
		understood that the soul (ψυχή psūchê) must have a logical faculty,
		the exercise of which was the most divine of human actions. At his
		defense trial, Socrates even summarized his teaching as nothing other
		than an exhortation for his fellow Athenians to excel in matters of
		the psyche since all bodily goods are dependent on such excellence
		(Apology 30a–b). Anima mundi is the concept of a "world soul"
		connecting all living organisms on planet Earth.
